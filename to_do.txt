-implement promotion for pawn when it reaches the other side
-50 move no capture rule for draw
-threefold repetition rule for draw

-board and piece movement sound effects

a menu with modes:
1) tabletop
2) single player vs AI
3) multiplayer online

obviously implement all of the modes

background music for the menu (and game?)

add algebraic saving for reduced game file sizes? might be more economical for mutliplayer and better for single player app sizes/AND FOR THREEFOLD RULE (maybe just use a custom hash function?)

-launch screen (required)

-app delegate file and figure out the use for all the other template files (theyre there for a reason)

-black king dark mode app icon (need xcode 16 for that) (possibly add with an update)

settings for color scheme? (beige, grayscale, black/white/red, other?)
-alternate board color schemes in settings?

-add stalemate checking/ending

-pawn does not capture difrectly in front of it, if there is a peice in front of a pawn make the move up one move invalid (modify in pieceRules)



UNDO FOR PRODUCTION:
reenable main music menu (mainmenuview)
reenable player turns (gamescene)

possibly get original sound effects not from chess.com to avoid getting bent over my saul goodman



other notes:

Beige colors for board:
Light tile: #ffce9e
"Grey" tile: #e8ab6f
Dark tile: #d18b47


need to atribute artist of the chess images somewhere in the app,
maybe a credits menu in settings?

Future updates: refactor touchDown and TouchUP in GameScene
refactor is king in check function to use a global variable instead of searching for it every single time
