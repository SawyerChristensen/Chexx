online multiplayer (need to implement online play) (no icons, need name checking)
    -better player turn notification
    -restricting players to only moving their color
    -bug: rejoining does not display the most recent board state, only the very last move?
    -bug: if youre not signed in, theres no error message for creating a game, only an unexplained failure
    -allow non-signed in users to play multiplayer with just a code?
    -add random matchmaking if youre signed in
    
-name checking for online play (also set default name to full name instead of single)

-basic tutorial

-facebook sign in
    -enable Sign in with Apple (LAST STEP, NEEDS AN APPLE DEVELOPER ACCOUNT)(COSTS $100 A YEAR)

Bugs:
-user country loads from firestore every time profile is opened, local storage should update from firestore once the app is opened, then pull from local every profile view
-enpassant will not work for online play, code sets enpassant to true in gamescene, not gamestate with movepiece func (test)




BEFORE LAUNCH:
-app delegate file and figure out the use for all the other template files (theyre there for a reason)
-figure out if I really need these silly storyboard files still, can probably delete with some modification to other files
    -launch screen (required) & main menu /is it???
    
-need to atribute artist of the chess images somewhere in the app,
maybe a credits menu in settings?
the proper attribution:
"By Cburnett - Own work, CC BY-SA 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:SVG_chess_pieces"

-reenable main music menu if disabled (mainmenuview)

-test if auto promote to queen actually works




FOR FUTURE UPDATES:

-make games more secure, this works for now

-50 move no capture rule for draw

-threefold repetition rule for draw
    -Zobrist hashing for more efficient computation of three-fold rule detection, not needed at launch, could be an important update

-Leaderboard button underneath profile view, simply rank all users by ELO (icon represented by trophy)
    -display first name, country emoji, elo?

-optimizations to game CPU

-game history button in profile view? (store past user games, who vs who, and then display hex fen format)
    -single player stored on device, multiplayer stored in cloud

-haptic feedback on check?

    -alternate board color schemes in settings? (beige, grayscale, black/white/red, other?)
        beige:  Light tile: #ffce9e     "Grey" tile: #e8ab6f        Dark tile: #d18b47
    -put ^ in profile view?
        
-check if any flags have been added in new unicode versions

-favorite opening in profile view?

enable variants, DIFFERENT PAWN RULES FOR MATHEWSONS & MCCOOEYS (as well as starting positions being different)

-enable a "show row/columns A-L 1-11" option in settings

-enable an option to play as black against the CPU (would need to change promotion logic)

-current implementation reloaded the gamescene every status text update. not important but it shouldnt be doing that




Current Minimax algorithm takes: (seems to multiply by 10 every depth)
Depth 1:    0.01 seconds
Depth 2:    ~0.2 seconds
Depth 3:    ~2.0 seoncds depth 3 is target default
Depth 4:    ~20 seconds (unacceptable)

look for current eval functions that loop through the game state, they are all likely o^2 and slow

use hashing/transposition tables/other tech to speed this up especially at higher depths when we potentially eval the same state multiple times

Possible Future Optimizations:
DONE? Alpha-Beta Pruning (done? make suer it works optimally) Up to 10x reduction in search space
Multi-Threading (Parallel Search) Up to 2-8x speedup, depending on hardware (MAKE SURE IT DOESNT LOAD THE GS EVERY THREAD, MIGHT BE THE REASON ITS SO SLOW RN)
Hashing (Zobrist Hashing) 10-50% speedup
Transposition Tables (TT) 20-100% speedup (depending on position complexity)
Parallelized Evaluation Functions 2-4x speedup, depending on how parallelizable the evaluation function is
Simd (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) and GPU Offloading 2-10x speedup, depending on hardware and implementation
Move Ordering and Iterative Deepening 10-30% speedup (did move ordering)
Late Move Reductions 10-30% speedup
Null Move Pruning 10-20% speedup

-prioritizes looking at branches over the current branch max that involve a piece if the user taps on a piece, likely to be moving that piece
-doing cpu calculations in the background, with increasing depths, obviously use this ^ idea

Might be able to get to depth 4 with all of these improvements


RESOURCES:

-Stalemate is not a draw. Instead the player delivering stalemate receives 0.75 points and the stalemated receives 0.25 (implement for multiplayer ruling)
