-50 move no capture rule for draw
-threefold repetition rule for draw
    -implement
    
-forgot password option for email users, shows up if you enter password in wrong

-Zobrist hashing for more efficient computation of three-fold rule detection, not needed at launch, could be an important update

-board and piece movement sound effects /"done" but need different ones

-haptic feedback on check?

a menu with modes:
1) tabletop
2) single player vs AI
3) multiplayer online

obviously implement all of the modes

-add stalemate checking/ending

-app delegate file and figure out the use for all the other template files (theyre there for a reason)
-figure out if I really need these silly storyboard files still, can probably delete with some modification to other files
    -launch screen (required) & main menu /is it???
    
-need to atribute artist of the chess images somewhere in the app,
maybe a credits menu in settings?

UNDO FOR PRODUCTION:
reenable main music menu (mainmenuview)
reenable player turns (gamescene)

-possibly get original sound effects not from chess.com to avoid getting bent over by saul goodman

FOR FUTURE UPDATES:
    -alternate board color schemes in settings? (beige, grayscale, black/white/red, other?)
        beige:  Light tile: #ffce9e     "Grey" tile: #e8ab6f        Dark tile: #d18b47
        
-check if any flags have been added in new unicode versions

enable variants, DIFFERENT PAWN RULES FOR MATHEWSONS & MCCOOEYS (as well as starting positions being different)
