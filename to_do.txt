-move checking/checkmate/stalemate logic into gamestate
-implement cpu
-enable the cpu to actually affect gamescene
-settings options (down below)
    -background music toggle
    -sound effects toggle
    -show legal moves toggle (done)
    -show name in multiplayer toggle
    -low motion toggle (in pass and play)

-dark mode should be grey background, same color buttons, white title text. not as blinding, but not b&w

-50 move no capture rule for draw
-threefold repetition rule for draw
    
-forgot password option for email users, shows up if you enter password in wrong

-Zobrist hashing for more efficient computation of three-fold rule detection, not needed at launch, could be an important update

a main menu with modes:
1) pass & play (done)
2) single player vs AI (need to implement ai)
3) multiplayer online (need to implement online play) (should be implemented last) (no icons, need name checking)

-Leaderboard button underneath profile view, simply rank all users by ELO (icon represented by trophy)
    -display name, country emoji, elo
    
-name checking for online play (also set default name to full name instead of single)



BEFORE LAUNCH:

-app delegate file and figure out the use for all the other template files (theyre there for a reason)
-figure out if I really need these silly storyboard files still, can probably delete with some modification to other files
    -launch screen (required) & main menu /is it???
    
-need to atribute artist of the chess images somewhere in the app,
maybe a credits menu in settings?

-game history button in profile view (store past user games, who vs who, and then display hex fen format)
    -single player stored on device, multiplayer stored in cloud

-reenable main music menu if disabled (mainmenuview)


FOR FUTURE UPDATES:

-haptic feedback on check?

    -alternate board color schemes in settings? (beige, grayscale, black/white/red, other?)

    -put ^ in profile view?
        
-check if any flags have been added in new unicode versions

-favorite opening in profile view?

enable variants, DIFFERENT PAWN RULES FOR MATHEWSONS & MCCOOEYS (as well as starting positions being different)

-enable a "show row/columns A-L 1-11" option in settings
