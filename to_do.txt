-implement promotion for pawn when it reaches the other side
-implement en passant capture for pawn

-tapping and highlighting available movements

-proper rotation of screen so that it doesnt zoom in

-board and piece movement sound effects

a menu with modes:
1) tabletop
2) single player vs AI
3) multiplayer online

obviously implement all of the modes

background music for the menu (and game?)

add algebraic saving for reduced game file sizes? might be more economical for mutliplayer and better for single player app sizes

-launch screen (required)

-app delegate file and figure out the use for all the other template files (theyre there for a reason)

-black king dark mode app icon (need xcode 16 for that) (possibly add with an update)

settings for color scheme?
-alternate board color schemes in settings?
