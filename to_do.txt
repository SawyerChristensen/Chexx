-Stalemate is not a draw. Instead the player delivering stalemate receives 0.75 points and the stalemated receives 0.25 (implement for multiplayer ruling)

-in multiplayer, add the players flag next to their username if they have a country selected in profile view

-game center icon only loads the second time looking at the profile

-if you create an online game, enter, do nothing, and leave, the game does not automatically get deleted. this is currently not an issue since each account is "allowed" one empty created game. any previously created game is removed from the server every new create game function call, although it would be better to just delete the game when the game view is dismissed and it is empty

-login does not check if your email is actually real

-facebook sign in?

-in multiplayer, show opponents game center icon if they dont have a google icon

-if user is anonymous, do not update elo
    -is this still needed?
    
-user country loads from firestore every time profile is opened, local storage should update from firestore once the app is opened, then pull from local every profile view
-elo is checked every profile view, can maybe use a local toggle to see if its been changed in a recent game before asking the server, eliminating redundant server calls (not necessary for now)
-store user picture on device and only load when it changes? having it load is a little jarring (low priority)

*----------* UPDATE 1.2 *----------* (Multiplayer Update)



-gameCPU will not see knight's moves upon promotion, only queen

-Leaderboard button underneath profile view, simply rank all users by ELO (icon represented by trophy)
    -display first name, country emoji, elo?
    
-end game screen displaying username instead of color?

-add random matchmaking if youre signed in?
    -if added, need name checking for online play (just hide the icons, unless joining a friends game)

-make games more secure? (this works perfectly fine for now)

-enable an option to play as black against the CPU (would need to change promotion logic)

-optimizations to game CPU

Current Minimax algorithm takes: (seems to multiply by 10 every depth)
Depth 1:    0.01 seconds
Depth 2:    ~0.2 seconds
Depth 3:    ~2.0 seoncds depth 3 is target default
Depth 4:    ~20 seconds (unacceptable)

look for current eval functions that loop through the game state, they are all likely o^2 and slow

use hashing/transposition tables/other tech to speed this up especially at higher depths when we potentially eval the same state multiple times

Possible Future Optimizations:
DONE? Alpha-Beta Pruning (done? make suer it works optimally) Up to 10x reduction in search space
Multi-Threading (Parallel Search) Up to 2-8x speedup, depending on hardware (MAKE SURE IT DOESNT LOAD THE GS EVERY THREAD, MIGHT BE THE REASON ITS SO SLOW RN)
Hashing (Zobrist Hashing) 10-50% speedup
Transposition Tables (TT) 20-100% speedup (depending on position complexity)
Parallelized Evaluation Functions 2-4x speedup, depending on how parallelizable the evaluation function is
Simd (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) and GPU Offloading 2-10x speedup, depending on hardware and implementation
Move Ordering and Iterative Deepening 10-30% speedup (did move ordering)
Late Move Reductions 10-30% speedup
Null Move Pruning 10-20% speedup

-prioritizes looking at branches over the current branch max that involve a piece if the user taps on a piece, likely to be moving that piece
-doing cpu calculations in the background, with increasing depths, obviously use this ^ idea

Might be able to get to depth 4 with all of these improvements
