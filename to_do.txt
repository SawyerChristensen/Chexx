-move checking/checkmate/stalemate logic into gamestate?
-implement cpu
-enable the cpu to actually affect gamescene
-settings options (down below)
    -background music toggle
    -sound effects toggle
    -show legal moves toggle (done)
    -show name in multiplayer toggle
    -low motion toggle (in pass and play)
    

    
-the game is currently loading the game state every scene reload (or maybe move?) (hard drive is slow!!)
    
FIX QUEEN MOVEMENT (BROKE AF RN)

-dark mode should be grey background, same color buttons, white title text. not as blinding, but not b&w
-sounds for main menu button presses (not for a button that starts any games, or profile/settings)

-50 move no capture rule for draw
-threefold repetition rule for draw
    
-forgot password option for email users, shows up if you enter password in wrong

-Zobrist hashing for more efficient computation of three-fold rule detection, not needed at launch, could be an important update

a main menu with modes:
1) pass & play (done)
2) single player vs AI (need to implement ai)
3) multiplayer online (need to implement online play) (should be implemented last) (no icons, need name checking)

-Leaderboard button underneath profile view, simply rank all users by ELO (icon represented by trophy)
    -display name, country emoji, elo
    
-name checking for online play (also set default name to full name instead of single)


Bugs:
tile highlight does not stay on rotate




BEFORE LAUNCH:

-app delegate file and figure out the use for all the other template files (theyre there for a reason)
-figure out if I really need these silly storyboard files still, can probably delete with some modification to other files
    -launch screen (required) & main menu /is it???
    
-need to atribute artist of the chess images somewhere in the app,
maybe a credits menu in settings?

-game history button in profile view (store past user games, who vs who, and then display hex fen format)
    -single player stored on device, multiplayer stored in cloud

-reenable main music menu if disabled (mainmenuview)

-test if auto promote to queen actually works


FOR FUTURE UPDATES:

-haptic feedback on check?

    -alternate board color schemes in settings? (beige, grayscale, black/white/red, other?)
        beige:  Light tile: #ffce9e     "Grey" tile: #e8ab6f        Dark tile: #d18b47
    -put ^ in profile view?
        
-check if any flags have been added in new unicode versions

-favorite opening in profile view?

enable variants, DIFFERENT PAWN RULES FOR MATHEWSONS & MCCOOEYS (as well as starting positions being different)

-enable a "show row/columns A-L 1-11" option in settings

-enable an option to play as black against the CPU (would need to change promotion logic)

-current implementation reloaded the gamescene every status text update. not important but it shouldnt be doing that





Current Minimax algorithm takes:
Depth 1:    0.01 seconds
Depth 2:    ~0.4 seconds
Depth 3:    2.30 seoncds (often much more, ~6 sec, 2.3 seems to be the MINIMUM) (also unnacceptable) depth 3 is target default
Depth 4:    ~45 seconds (unacceptable)
use hashing/transposition tables/other tech to speed this up especially at higher depths when we potentially eval the same state multiple times

Possible Future Optimizations:
DONE? Alpha-Beta Pruning (done? make suer it works optimally) Up to 10x reduction in search space
Multi-Threading (Parallel Search) Up to 2-8x speedup, depending on hardware (MAKE SURE IT DOESNT LOAD THE GS EVERY THREAD, MIGHT BE THE REASON ITS SO SLOW RN)
Hashing (Zobrist Hashing) 10-50% speedup
Transposition Tables (TT) 20-100% speedup (depending on position complexity)
Parallelized Evaluation Functions 2-4x speedup, depending on how parallelizable the evaluation function is
Simd (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) and GPU Offloading 2-10x speedup, depending on hardware and implementation
Move Ordering and Iterative Deepening 10-30% speedup (did move ordering)
Late Move Reductions 10-30% speedup
Null Move Pruning 10-20% speedup

Might be able to get to depth 4 with all of these improvements


RESOURCES:

-Stalemate is not a draw. Instead the player delivering stalemate receives 0.75 points and the stalemated receives 0.25
