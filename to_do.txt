-implement promotion for pawn when it reaches the other side
-50 move no capture rule for draw
-threefold repetition rule for draw

-board and piece movement sound effects

a menu with modes:
1) tabletop
2) single player vs AI
3) multiplayer online

obviously implement all of the modes

background music for the menu (and game?)

add algebraic saving for reduced game file sizes? might be more economical for mutliplayer and better for single player app sizes/AND FOR THREEFOLD RULE (maybe just use a custom hash function?)

-launch screen (required)

-app delegate file and figure out the use for all the other template files (theyre there for a reason)

-black king dark mode app icon (need xcode 16 for that) (possibly add with an update)

settings for color scheme? (beige, grayscale, black/white/red, other?)
-alternate board color schemes in settings?

-add stalemate checking/ending






other notes:

Beige colors for board:
Light tile: #ffce9e
"Grey" tile: #e8ab6f
Dark tile: #d18b47


need to atribute artist of the chess images somewhere in the app,
maybe a credits menu in settings?
