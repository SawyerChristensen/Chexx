# Hexagonal Chess

HexChess is a modern take on traditional chess, invented in 1936 by Władysław Gliński. Designed to challenge experienced chess players with a unique hexagonal board, normal chess pattern recognition does not apply here. It is still just as easy to learn as normal chess, leveling the playing field between Grandmaster and beginner.
