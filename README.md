# Hexagonal Chess ♟️

HexChess is a modern take on traditional chess, invented in 1936 by Władysław Gliński and coming to the App Store by Sawyer Christensen. Designed to challenge experienced chess players with a unique hexagonal board, normal chess pattern recognition does not apply here. Being just as easy to learn as traditional chess, it levels the playing field between Grandmaster and Beginner.

*Expected Release: Late 2024/Early 2025*
